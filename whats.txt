Next Steps to Get Running
1. Setup Database (5 minutes)
Open MySQL command line or phpMyAdmin and run:


# From the int directory
mysql -u root < database/schema.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/01_roles.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/02_permissions.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/03_departments.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/04_users.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/05_inventory_master.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/06_workflows.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/07_number_sequences.sql
mysql -u root inventory_system < database/seeds/08_system_config.sql
2. Start WAMP & Test (2 minutes)
Start WAMP server
Visit: http://localhost/int/public/
Login with:
Username: admin
Password: Admin@123
You should see the General Administration Manager dashboard!

3. Test Other Roles
Try logging in with different roles to see role-based navigation:

requester1 / Admin@123 - See requester dashboard
stores / Admin@123 - See stores officer dashboard
supervisor_it / Admin@123 - See supervisor dashboard
What's Ready to Use NOW
✅ Login system - Fully functional with session management

✅ Role-based dashboards - Different views per role

✅ Security - CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection

✅ Database - All 30+ tables with sample data

✅ Navigation - Role-based sidebar menus

✅ Layouts - Professional UI with Tailwind CSS

What's Next (Remaining Phases)
The foundation is solid! Here's what remains from the 18-week plan:

Phase 2: Inventory & GRV Module

Phase 3: Workflow Engine (CRITICAL - the heart of the system)

Phase 4: Request Management

Phase 5: Issuance & Release

Phase 6: Fuel Coupon Management

Phase 7: Notifications

Phase 8-9: Advanced Dashboards & Reports

Phase 10-12: Audit, Security, Testing

Would you like me to:

Continue with Phase 2 (Inventory & GRV)?
Jump to Phase 3 (Workflow Engine - the most critical)?
Test the current setup together?
Focus on a specific feature you need urgently?
The system is already usable for authentication and basic navigation - ready to build on! 🚀
