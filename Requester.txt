3. Workflow Engine (Key MVP Feature)
Workflow Characteristics

Dynamic & configurable

Workflow = ordered list of approval steps

Each step assigned to:

Role (not individual user)

Optional conditions (amount, item category)

Department Supervisor Controls

Configure department workflow

Number of approval steps

Internal department approvals

Cannot remove central admin approvals

Cannot bypass Admin Manager or General Admin Manager

System-Enforced Global Flow (Non-Configurable)

Regardless of department workflow:

Administration Manager

General Administration Manager

Stores Officer (release instruction)

Department workflows are inserted before the Admin Manager step.

4. Request Approval Flow (MVP Default)

Requester submits request

Department workflow approvals occur

Request arrives at Administration Manager

Then moves to General Administration Manager

Approved request triggers Release Instruction

Stores Officer issues items

Request marked Fulfilled

5. Stores & Issuance

View approved release instructions

Create Issue Voucher

Request reference

Items issued

Quantity issued

Issued by / received by

Partial issuance allowed

Inventory updated automatically

Close request only when fully issued

6. Configuration & Administration

Roles and permissions

Item categories

Units of measure

Stores / locations

Approval rules (non-editable by departments)

Department Configuration

Department workflow setup

Default approvers

Approval thresholds (optional MVP+)

7. Audit, Logs & Compliance (MVP Required)

Immutable audit log for:

Requests

Approvals

GRVs

Issues

Timestamp, user, action tracking

No hard deletes (soft delete only)

8. Notifications (MVP)

Email / in-app notifications for:

Pending approvals

Request rejection/return

Release instructions to stores

Reminder notifications (optional MVP+)

9. Reports & Dashboards (MVP)

Stock on hand

Stock movement (GRV vs issues)

Requests by department

Approval turnaround time

Low stock alerts

10. Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Web-based responsive UI

Secure authentication

Performance: < 3s response for core actions

Scalable workflow engine

Configurations stored as data (not hardcoded)

11. Out of Scope for MVP (Clearly Defined)

Purchase order management

Supplier invoicing

Budgeting & financial accounting

Barcode / RFID

Mobile app (web only)

12. Fuel Request & Fuel Coupon Management (MVP Extension)
Conceptual Model

Fuel is stored as fuel coupons, not liters

Each coupon represents:

Fuel type (Petrol / Diesel)

Monetary value or fixed liters

Fuel coupons behave like inventory items with special rules

13. Fuel Coupon Inventory
Fuel Coupon Item Type

Fuel coupons are a special inventory category with:

Coupon ID / Serial number

Fuel type

Value (amount or liters)

Expiry date (optional)

Status: Available / Issued / Expired / Cancelled

Entry Rule (Mandatory)

Fuel coupons must be added via GRV, same as other inventory

GRV for fuel requires:

Supplier (Fuel station / vendor)

Coupon range (From–To) or quantity

Total value

Fuel type

14. Fuel Request (Requester Side)
Fuel Request Form

Requester can create a Fuel Request with:

Vehicle / equipment identifier

Fuel type

Requested value or quantity

Purpose (mission, trip, generator, etc.)

Date required

Department

Fuel requests use the same workflow engine as item requests.

15. Fuel Request Approval Flow

Fuel requests follow the same approval hierarchy:

Department workflow approvals

Administration Manager

General Administration Manager

Stores Officer (fuel coupon issuance)

No parallel or shortcut flow — consistency is key.

16. Stores Officer – Fuel Issuance
Fuel Coupon Issuance

View approved fuel release instructions

Assign specific coupons to request

Create Fuel Issue Voucher

Request reference

Coupon IDs issued

Total value / liters

Issued to (driver / requester)

Mark coupons as Issued

Close fuel request when fully issued

Partial issuance:

Allowed if coupon denominations require it

System tracks outstanding balance

17. Fuel-Specific Controls (MVP)
Validation Rules

Fuel requests can only be fulfilled using available coupons

Coupons cannot be reused

Expired coupons cannot be issued

Fuel type mismatch is blocked

Visibility

Requester can see:

Approved amount

Issued coupons

Admin can see:

Coupon utilization

Fuel consumption by department / vehicle

18. Reporting (Fuel)

Fuel coupons on hand (by type & value)

Issued fuel by department

Issued fuel by vehicle / equipment

Fuel request vs issuance variance

Expired / unused coupons

19. Permissions Summary (Fuel)
Role	Fuel Capabilities
Requester	Create fuel requests, view status
Dept Supervisor	Approve fuel requests
Admin Manager	Approve fuel requests
General Admin Manager	Final approval
Stores Officer	Manage coupons, issue fuel
20. Key Design Principle (Important)

Fuel is not deducted as stock quantity — it is tracked as coupon issuance, ensuring:

Strong auditability

Fraud prevention

Real-world alignment with operations
